# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of bars in the histogram.
# Space Complexity: O(n), since the stack can hold up to n bars in the worst case.
#
# This function calculates the largest rectangular area possible in a histogram.
# It uses a monotonic stack to efficiently keep track of bars in increasing order of height.
# As we iterate through each bar, we maintain the start index where the current height can extend back.
# When we encounter a bar that is shorter than the one on top of the stack, it means the rectangle
# formed by the taller bar on the stack has ended. We pop it from the stack and calculate its area
# using the width between the current index and the popped barâ€™s start index.
# After processing all bars, we go through the remaining stack to calculate areas
# for bars that extend to the end of the histogram.
# The result is the maximum area found among all such rectangles.
