# Time Complexity: O(m * n), where m and n are the number of rows and columns in the grid.
# Space Complexity: O(m * n) in the worst case, when all rooms are empty and added to the queue.
#
# This function updates each empty room in the grid with the distance to its nearest gate.
# Each cell can contain a gate (0), a wall (-1), or an empty room (INF, represented by 2147483647).
# The approach uses a multi-source BFS starting from all gates at once.
# First, all gate positions are added to the queue as starting points.
# Then, for each cell removed from the queue, we check its four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right).
# If a neighboring cell is an empty room (INF), we update its value to be the current cellâ€™s distance + 1,
# and add that neighbor to the queue to continue the BFS from there.
# This ensures that each room is updated with the shortest distance to the nearest gate.
# Since every cell is processed at most once, the algorithm runs efficiently in O(m * n).
