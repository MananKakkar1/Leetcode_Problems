# Time Complexity: O(m * n), where m and n are the number of rows and columns in the grid.
# Space Complexity: O(m * n) in the worst case due to the queue used in BFS when the entire grid is land.
#
# This function counts the number of islands in a 2D grid where '1' represents land and '0' represents water.
# It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to explore all connected land cells that form one island.
# The idea is to scan each cell in the grid; when we find a cell with '1', it marks the start of a new island.
# We then call BFS from that cell, marking all connected land cells as '0' to indicate theyâ€™ve been visited.
# The BFS explores in four directions (up, down, left, right) and ensures we stay within grid boundaries.
# Each time BFS finishes, it means one entire island has been visited, so we increment the island count.
# The algorithm continues until every cell in the grid has been processed, and the final count represents
# the total number of distinct islands.
